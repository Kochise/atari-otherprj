 	Summary of changes to the FPSP from Release 2.2 to Release 2.3
	--------------------------------------------------------------

Test files added in Release 2.3:

tests/source/Cpackdec.s
tests/source/Cunimp.s
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
	File-by-file short summary of changes
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
================= src_asm/x_unimp.sa, do_func.sa
 For all unimplemented instructions except for FMOD & FREM the quotient
field should be left unaffected but gets cleared.
 This release fixes this problem by clearing all but quotient/accrued exceptions.

================ src_asm/get_op.s
Binary (two-operand) operations which source a packed decimal entity and which
have fp1 as the destination operand deliver spurious results.
  An example of this code is
    FMOVE.S   #:400000000,FP1                 ; FP1 <- 2.0
    FADD.P    #:000000010000000000000000,FP1  ; FP1 <- 1.0 + 2.0

Fix was to save the contents of FP1 prior to its use in "decbin" and to restore the contents to fp1 after its use.

=================src_asm/l_entry.sa

In the library version of FPSP the control register was not restored before it
unlinks causes some erroneous results.

added code to restore fpcr before it unlinks.
