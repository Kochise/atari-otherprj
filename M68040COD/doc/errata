			Release 2.3 Errata

    As of this release, the following may be considered an
errata of the 040 (Mask 20D43B  Mask 4D50D and Mask 5D98D) FPSP:


    1. INEX1 reported by inexact conversion of packed source
       operand for a dyadic instruction will not be reported
       by the 040 upon completion of that instruction.  This 
       errata corresponds to errata "F5" on the 68040 Errata Sheet.
       Fixed in D98D.

    2. FREM and FMOD with packed operands will occasionally
       differ from the 881/2 results by one ulp in the conversion
       of the packed source operand.  

    3. INEX2/AINEX are not calculated in the same manner as in the 
       881/882 for some cases in which the result is overflowed.
       Currently, if the operation was an integer move-out, INEX2/AINEX
       is not set for any case.
       In some cases of fscale with integer input, the INEX2 bit will not
       be set on inex calculation.
       Under extended rounding precision, FSCALE results which underflow 
       and are inexact may be incorrectly rounded.  Inaddition, INEX2
       is not signaled in these cases.

    4. If an Fmove FPn,FPM(this also applies to the FNEG and FABS), is preceded        by any floating point operation with a denorm source operand , the FMOVE
       destination (FPm) is incorrectly tagged and may result in silent data
       corruption. A software fix in release 2.2.
