#	Inexact exception
#
#	All inexact exceptions are real, but the 'real' handler
#	will probably want to clear the pending exception.
#	The provided code will clear the E3 exception (if pending), 
#	otherwise clear the E1 exception.  The frestore is not really
#	necessary for E1 exceptions.
#
# Code following the 'inex' label is to handle bug #1232.  In this
# bug, if an E1 snan, ovfl, or unfl occured, and the process was
# swapped out before taking the exception, the exception taken on
# return was inex, rather than the correct exception.  The snan, ovfl,
# and unfl exception to be taken must not have been enabled.  The
# fix is to check for E1, and the existence of one of snan, ovfl,
# or unfl bits set in the fpsr.  If any of these are set, branch
# to the appropriate  handler for the exception in the fpsr.  Note
# that this fix is only for d43b parts, and is skipped if the
# version number is not $40.

#
# The supervisor source address is guaranteed to point into the supervisor
# stack.  The result is that a UNIX
# process is allowed to sleep as a consequence of a page fault during
# copyout.  The probability of a page fault is exceedingly small because
# the 68040 always reads the destination address and thus the page
# faults should have already been handled.
#
# If the EXC_SR shows that the exception was from supervisor space,
# then just do a dumb (and slow) memory move.  In a UNIX environment
# there shouldn't be any supervisor mode floating point exceptions.

# If you don't have copyin, use the local copy of the function below.
#
# The FPSP calls mem_read to read the original F-line instruction in order
# to extract the data register number when the 'Dn' addressing mode is
# used.
#
#Input:
#	a0 - user source address
#	a1 - supervisor destination address
#	d0 - number of bytes to read (maximum count is 12)
#
# Like mem_write, mem_read always reads with a supervisor 
# destination address on the supervisor stack.  Also like mem_write,
# the EXC_SR is checked and a simple memory copy is done if reading
# from supervisor space is indicated.
