This is a collection of IMG supporting source codes and utilities.
It is still not as complete as desired, but it already provides
some useful examples and tools:


ximgtool
========

This was the primary package for basic (X)IMG support.
It provides functions for optimization of and conversion
('transcoding') between different 'flavors' of IMG format
image files, comparable in some respect to the 'jpegtran'
tool from the Independent JPEG Group for JPEG files.


img2png
=======

This is a first 'quick-and-dirty' approach to a general IMG to PNG
conversion utility.
Note that you will need a properly installed libpng (and therefore
zlib) to get it run.  Adapt the Makefile accordingly where to find
the libpng and zlib libraries and header files.  The example was
successfully tested under standard SuSE 8.2 installation.
Current limitations:
- Grayscale TIMG files are not supported
  (not yet needed - easy to add when required).
- Alpha data is not retained.
- XIMG support only for 2, 4, 16, 256 colors (1,2,4,8 bit depth).
Please let me know of your problems or requirements for future
enhancements.
