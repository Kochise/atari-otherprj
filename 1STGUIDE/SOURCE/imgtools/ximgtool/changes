Aug 10 1995:

- ENCODERS.C:
  Improvements in raw encoders provide
  further savings on many images.

Jul 27 1995:

- XIMGTOOL/IMGCODEC.H:
  Improved portability for Intel-Systems.
  Checked with gcc on Linux.

Jun 18 1995:

- ENCODERS.C/IMGCODEC.H:
  Cleaned up code. The 'init'/'state' entry in the public image
  buffer struct is now named 'pad' to express the real intention
  of it's introduction (padding the struct to even boundary),
  since the encoders no longer make use of it.

Jun 06 1995:

- ENCODERS.C:
  Little improvements provide further savings on some images.

May 28 1995:

- MFDB_OUT.C:
  Removed error in mfdb_putline function:
  Case des_planes < src_planes caused 'big trouble'. Sorry.

- XIMGTOOL/ENCODERS.C:
  Improved behavior when converting truncated image files:
  All completely decoded lines are now encoded and written into
  output, in all Levels. Until now, lines were lost in truncated
  images (accumulative with every converting step) due to the line
  delay in encoding necessary for vrc handling. (In worst case, the
  whole image could be lost in one step at Level-3 if only missing
  a few bytes at the end.)
  To avoid this problem, only an additional flushing call after
  processing and before freeing the image buffer pointer is
  necessary (see XIMGTOOL.C, function do_proc). This is optional,
  without this call all works as before. It is really useful only
  in applications like XIMGTOOL, where it is not guaranteed that
  a full line is available at the end. If one can assume or even
  guarantee (in MFDB processing, for instance) to get full lines,
  it would be obsolete.
  But be aware, that the new scheme only works with the new
  encoders, it won't work with older versions, although
  no changes were introduced in the interfaces!
