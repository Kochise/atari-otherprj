FixPix adaptions to the Berkeley mpeg_play-2.3 code and
Erik Corry's multi-byte dither routines.

NOTE: I've only made necessary adaptions to get it work.

Works now in 15 bit mode (Yeah! The original version does not!)


16bit.c:

- Changed only InitColorDither() to make use of screen_rgb[]
  (located and initialized in util32.c).
  -> Code much simplified (removed all bit-check hassle...).

gdith.c:

- Minor clean-ups (remove bit/byte-order dependencies,
  remove argument for InitColorDither()).

main.c:
proto.h:

- Adaption in InitColorDither() prototype (no arguments).
- Use screen_bpp (located and initialized in util32.c) as
  'matched_depth' in VidStream instead of 'color depth' from XInfo!

util32.c:

- Added adapted screen_init() function, which is called by
  CreateFullColorWindow().
  Note: We arrange to fill in screen_rgb[] appropriately for Erik's
	doubling tricks here (instead of InitColorDither()).
- Removed check 'maxdepth < 16' in FindFullColorVisual()
  to get it work in 15 bit mode.
