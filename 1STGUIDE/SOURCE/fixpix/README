FixPix Release Notes				Halle, Aug 16 2008

	Developed 1996-2008 by Guido Vollbeding <guido@jpegclub.org>


		What is FixPix?


FixPix is a general (portable) algorithm for displaying true-color
(24-bit, usually) image data on direct-color graphics devices
(16-bit high-color or 24/32-bit true-color).

Currently available implementations support the X Window System,
the Virtual Device Interface (VDI) under GEM (Graphic Environment
Manager), and the Windows GDI.
Contributions for other platforms would be greatly appreciated.

The main feature of the FixPix algorithm is the generic method of
adaption to the particular bit-distribution of the output device
combined with the efficient pixel rendering scheme.

A special feature of FixPix is the optional adapted dithering
scheme providing smooth image display for less than 24-bit deep
output devices.


		Who needs FixPix?


You may consider to use FixPix if you are interested in

- A high degree of independence from particular hardware
  and driver software properties.
- More performance in true-color image display.
- Avoiding ugly color-banding artefacts when displaying
  true-color images on 16-bit displays. (See for example
    http://sylvana.net/samples/monument.jpg,
    http://sylvana.net/samples/glasses.jpeg,

		FixPix for XV 3.10a


You can immediately use FixPix with xv-3.10a from John Bradley
if you work on a 15/16/24/32-bit X display.

Just replace your original 'xvimage.c' (rename it to
'xvimage.c.orig') with the adapted xvimage.c in this
distribution and then recompile xv. That's all!
Please tell me if you encounter any problems on your platform.


		FixPix for Berkeley mpeg_play 2.3


Copy all files in the directory 'mpeg_play-2.3' into the
original distribution and recompile. Read FIXPIX_CHANGES.


		Sample code


There is documented sample code which describes the FixPix
algorithm:

- fixpix.h:  General declarations
- xfixpix.c: Sample implementation for the X Window System
- vfixpix.c: Sample implementation for the VDI under GEM
- winfixpix.cpp: Sample implementation for the Windows GDI


		Sample applications (without source code)


- Jpegcrop: http://sylvana.net/jpegcrop/
- 1stGuide: http://sylvana.net/1stguide/


		Tested environments


- Atari ST/TT/Falcon under TOS with GEM with any VDI graphics
  adapter or under any emulation.
- Linux-Pentium system with Accel-X-Server, Mach64 graphics
  card (2MB) with 15/16/24 screen depth used as display for
  xv-3.10a running remotely on a Sun-Sparcstation.
- Same as above, but xv running locally on the Linux machine :-).
- XFree86 3.1.2 and 3.1.2G in 16 bpp on a SPEA Mirage card
  (reported by Klaus.Steinberger@physik.uni-muenchen.de).
- Sun Ultra 1 creator with SOLARIS 2.5 and Openwin X-Server
  (reported by M G Berberich <berberic@forwiss.uni-passau.de>).
- Wintel systems running Jpegcrop in HighColor 16 bpp display modes.
